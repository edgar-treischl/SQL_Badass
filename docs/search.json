    "text": "Learning SQL the badass way is work in progress, keep that in mind if you start reading on these pages.\n\nPreface\nLearning SQL the badass way shows you the basic commands to manage tables and data with SQL. I assume that you are familiar with R (or other programming languages) to manipulate data. For this reason, this page only summarizes main idiosyncrasies of SQL, not concepts that you probably know from any other programming experience.\nI made the experience that learning new things always takes a lot of time and often I have the impression that many courses are designed without taking your personal experience into account. What a surprise, I can read and write some SQL code even I have no idea what SQL does and I guess you can too! This book is the result of this experience and gives a quick and dirty introduction, assuming that you have coding experience and I do not have to explain why we want to wrangle data in the first place.\nIf you do not have this impression or if you want to learn SQL in a proper way, close this book. Go and find your way to a real SQL course or some other resources. However, if you are bored from long introduction what data is, why we need to learn how to wrangle data or other common aspects that come along the data science journey, feel free to join my SQL journey.\nAs we already know, learning SQL is beneficial but maybe we need more motivational input. ChatGTP gives us the following reasons why we should learn SQL even if you are fluent in a language such as R:\n\nEfficient data management: SQL is designed to work with relational databases, which are ideal for managing large amounts of structured data. By learning SQL, R users can efficiently query, retrieve and manage data from databases using SQL commands, making their data analysis tasks more efficient.\nCollaborative work: SQL is a common language used by data analysts and data engineers, making it easier to collaborate and share data between different teams. By learning SQL, R users can communicate more effectively with other data professionals and work collaboratively on projects.\nIntegration with R: R users often work with data that is stored in databases, and SQL provides a way to query and retrieve data from these databases directly into R. This integration allows R users to take advantage of the power of SQL for data management, while still working with their preferred R environment.\nAdvanced data manipulation: SQL provides powerful features for data manipulation, including filtering, sorting, aggregating and joining data from multiple tables. By learning SQL, R users can take advantage of these advanced features to manipulate their data in more sophisticated ways.\nJob market demand: SQL is a widely used skill in the data analytics job market. By learning SQL, R users can broaden their skillset and increase their job market competitiveness.\n\nIn addition, ChatGTP also helps us to get an overview about the most important R packages that are commonly used for working with SQL, including:\n\ndplyr: A powerful package for data manipulation that can connect to various SQL databases and perform operations such as filtering, grouping, and joining (Wickham et al. 2023).\nDBI: An R package that provides a common interface for connecting to various SQL databases (, Wickham, and Müller 2022).\nRMySQL and RSQLite: Packages that provide an interface for connecting to MySQL and SQLite databases, respectively (Ooms et al. 2022; Müller et al. 2023).\nRJDBC: A package that provides a JDBC interface for connecting to various databases, including Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL (Urbanek 2022).\nRODBC: A package that provides an ODBC interface for connecting to various databases, including Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL (Ripley and Lapsley 2022).\nsqldf: A package that allows you to run SQL queries on data frames in R (Grothendieck 2017).\n\nOverall, the choice of which package to use will depend on the specific database you’re working with and your preferred interface. However, these packages should provide a good starting point for working with SQL in R, but first we need to outline some SQL basics.\n\n\n\n\nGrothendieck, G. 2017. “Sqldf: Manipulate r Data Frames Using SQL.” https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sqldf.\n\n\nMüller, Kirill, Hadley Wickham, David A.

For instance, ORDER BY country:\n\nSELECT * FROM df ORDER BY country;\n\n\n4 records\n\n\ncountry\ny\nz\nid\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n1\n8.5\n2\n\n\nBrazil\n4\n2.5\n3\n\n\nBrazil\n3\n3.5\n3\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the entries are ordered in an ascending order, but we can sort in a descending with DESC option as well:\n\n\nSELECT * FROM df ORDER BY country DESC;\n\n\n4 records\n\n\ncountry\ny\nz\nid\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\n\n\nBrazil\n4\n2.5\n3\n\n\nBrazil\n3\n3.5\n3\n\n\nAustria\n1\n8.5\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we have several observations per unit or any kind of structural order, which is why we may want to order a specific variable. We can sort the data by providing the number of the column we want to use a sort. As the next example shows, we can use y (or 2) to sort the data:\n\nSELECT * FROM df ORDER BY y;\n\n\n4 records\n\n\ncountry\ny\nz\nid\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n1\n8.5\n2\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\n\n\nBrazil\n3\n3.5\n3\n\n\nBrazil\n4\n2.5\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Grouping result sets\nTo work with data, we have to get rid of duplicates and often it is much more easier if we restrict result set (data frame). To exclude duplicates we can use the distinct() command, which returns only distinct countries in our example:\n\nSELECT distinct(country) FROM df ;\n\n\n3 records\n\n\ncountry\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nAustria\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar fashion, maybe we have to clarify how many observations do we have per group? Or in our case, how many entries come from the same country and how often appears each level? In such a case we can count the county column and use the group by clause:\n\nSELECT country, count (country) from df group by country;\n\n\n3 records\n\n\ncountry\ncount (country)\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n1\n\n\nBrazil\n2\n\n\nGermany\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the last output showed, the count functions literally counts, but SQL does not give it a name, it simply displays what it does. We can change this ugly behaviour by providing a variable name and tell SQL how the column should be listed.\n\nSELECT country, count (country) AS Count_Variable from df group by country;\n\n\n3 records\n\n\ncountry\nCount_Variable\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n1\n\n\nBrazil\n2\n\n\nGermany\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly, counting is not the only function. We can estimate the mean average with AVG(). And now the average, little SQL monkey!\n\nSELECT country, AVG(z) as Mean from df group by country;\n\n\n3 records\n\n\ncountry\nMean\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n8.5\n\n\nBrazil\n3.0\n\n\nGermany\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can set a further conditions with a grouped by clause and add the HAVING option. As the next output shows, the group by country HAVING count (country) > 1 returns only countries with more than one observation counted:\n\nSELECT country, count (country) AS Count from df group by country having count (country) > 1;\n\n\n1 records\n\n\ncountry\nCount\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us try to remember that the WHEREclause is for entire result set; while HAVING works only for the GROUPED BY clause.\nCongratulations! At this point you are able to:\n\nUse the WHERE clause to refine your query results\nUse the wildcard character (%) as a substitute for unknown characters in a pattern\nUse BETWEEN … AND to specify a range of numbers\nWe can sort query results into ascending or descending order, by using the ORDER BY clause\nAnd we can group query results by using the GROUP BY clause."

    "section": "3.2 Built-in Database Functions",
    "text": "3.2 Built-in Database Functions\nWe saw in the last section that we can aggregate (count, avg) data and use column functions. Most of the basic statistics functions (sum, avg, min, max) are available and we can specify further conditions, for instance, if we want to summarize groups:\n\nselect sum(mpg) as sum_mpg from mtcars where hp > 100\n\n\n1 records\n\n\nsum_mpg\n\n\n\n\n401.4\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we may use the scalar function and round to the nearest integer:\n\nselect round(drat, 1) as round_drat from mtcars\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nround_drat\n\n\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n\n\n\nIn SQL, there is a class of scalar functions. For instance, we can calculate the length of a string:\n\nselect length(country) from df\n\n\n4 records\n\n\nlength(country)\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n7\n\n\n6\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending the SQL database you use, in db2 you can use the upper (UCASE) and lower case (LCASE) function for strings.\n\nselect upper(country) from df\n\n\n4 records\n\n\nupper(country)\n\n\n\n\nGERMANY\n\n\nAUSTRIA\n\n\nBRAZIL\n\n\nBRAZIL\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case of Oracle the functions are called lower and upper.\n\n3.2.1 Date and Time Built-in Functions\nTalking about SQL databases, there are three different possibilities to work with date and time DB2.\n- Date: YYYYMMDD (Year/Month/Day) - Time: HHMMSS (Hours/Min/Sec) - Timestamp: YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZZZZZZ (Date/Time/Microseconds)\nDepending on what you are up to do, there are functions to extract the day, month, day of month, day of week, day of year, week, hour, minute, and second. You can also extract the current_date and the current_time. Unfortunately, this does not work in Oracle the same way as in DB2, but to give you an example how to extract the day:\n\nselect day(date) from df where country = 'Germany'\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Sub-Queries and Nested Selects\nSub-queries or sub selects are like regular queries but placed within parentheses and nested inside another query. This allows you to form more powerful queries than would have been otherwise possible. An example:\n\nselect avg(mpg) from mtcars\n\n\n1 records\n\n\navg(mpg)\n\n\n\n\n20.09062\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say we want to select only the observations with higher values than the average of mpg:\n\nselect * from mtcars where mpg > avg(mpg)\n\nThis would produce the following error: misuse of aggregate function avg() Failed to execute SQL chunk. One of the limitations of built in aggregate functions, like avg(), is that they cannot be evaluated in the WHERE clause always. Thus, we have to use sub-queries.\n\nselect * from mtcars where mpg >\n  (select avg(mpg) from mtcars);\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n24.4\n4\n146.7\n62\n3.69\n3.190\n20.00\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n22.8\n4\n140.8\n95\n3.92\n3.150\n22.90\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n32.4\n4\n78.7\n66\n4.08\n2.200\n19.47\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n30.4\n4\n75.7\n52\n4.93\n1.615\n18.52\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n33.9\n4\n71.1\n65\n4.22\n1.835\n19.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.5\n4\n120.1\n97\n3.70\n2.465\n20.01\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nColum expressions help to set sub queries as a list of columns. Say we select variable Z:\n\nselect country, z from df\n\n\n4 records\n\n\ncountry\nz\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n3.6\n\n\nAustria\n8.5\n\n\nBrazil\n2.5\n\n\nBrazil\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in the next step we add the average of all countries:\n\nselect country, z, avg(z) as avg_Z from df\n\n\n1 records\n\n\ncountry\nz\navg_Z\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n3.6\n4.525\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is obviously wrong. We cannot calculate on micro and macro level the same time, but we could use a sub-query (also called table expressions) to achieve it:\n\nselect country, z, (select avg(z) from df group by country) as avg_Z from df\n\n\n4 records\n\n\ncountry\nz\navg_Z\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n3.6\n8.5\n\n\nAustria\n8.5\n8.5\n\n\nBrazil\n2.5\n8.5\n\n\nBrazil\n3.5\n8.5\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-queries can also be applied in the from clause. They are called derived tables or table expressions, because the outer query uses the results of the sub-query as a data source\n\nselect * from (select hp, vs from mtcars);\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nhp\nvs\n\n\n\n\n110\n0\n\n\n110\n0\n\n\n93\n1\n\n\n110\n1\n\n\n175\n0\n\n\n105\n1\n\n\n245\n0\n\n\n62\n1\n\n\n95\n1\n\n\n123\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Working with Multiple Tables\nThere are several ways to access multiple tables in the same query. Namely, using sub-queries, implicit join, and join operators, such as INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN. For instance:\n\nselect * from df2;\n\n\n2 records\n\n\ncountry\nvalid\nid\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n1\n1\n\n\nAustria\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say we want only observations from df that are listed in df2. In such a situation we can use a sub-queries:\n\nselect * from df\n  where country in\n  (select country from df2)\n\n\n2 records\n\n\ncountry\ny\nz\nid\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\n\n\nAustria\n1\n8.5\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you could add also information of the second table and include only countries with a certain value:\n\nselect * from df\n  where country in\n  (select country from df2 where valid = 1)\n\n\n1 records\n\n\ncountry\ny\nz\nid\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nImplicit joins implies that we can access multiple tables by specifying them in the FROM clause of the query. This leads to a CROSS JOIN (also known as Cartesian Join).\n\nselect * from df, df2\n\n\n8 records\n\n\ncountry\ny\nz\nid\ncountry\nvalid\nid\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\nGermany\n1\n1\n\n\nGermany\n2\n3.6\n1\nAustria\n0\n2\n\n\nAustria\n1\n8.5\n2\nGermany\n1\n1\n\n\nAustria\n1\n8.5\n2\nAustria\n0\n2\n\n\nBrazil\n4\n2.5\n3\nGermany\n1\n1\n\n\nBrazil\n4\n2.5\n3\nAustria\n0\n2\n\n\nBrazil\n3\n3.5\n3\nGermany\n1\n1\n\n\nBrazil\n3\n3.5\n3\nAustria\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nIn DBL2 we can use the where clause to match data (see code); in Oracle there are other matching operaters\n\nselect * from df, df2 where df.id = df.id;\n\nIn case of long names, we can use shorter aliases for table names (or use column names with aliases in the SELECT clause):\n\nselect * from df A, df2 B where A.id = B.id;"
